/**
 * The numbers in the documentation are the numbers the suites produce.
 *
 * Every document in this repository quotes counts — how many checks run, how
 * many suites there are, how many security checks attack rather than assert.
 * Those numbers were corrected by hand five times while this project was being
 * written, and were wrong in at least three documents on three separate
 * occasions, because a number in prose has nothing holding it to the thing it
 * describes.
 *
 * That matters more here than it would elsewhere. The whole argument this
 * repository makes is that its claims are checkable; a README that overstates
 * its own test count by forty is a small lie that costs the large claim its
 * credibility. So the counts are derived by running the suites and compared
 * against what the documents say.
 *
 * Deliberately tolerant in one direction and strict in another: a document may
 * quote a *rounded* figure ("about four seconds"), but an exact integer that
 * claims to be a check count has to be one. The tolerance below is zero for
 * counts; time is not checked at all, because it is a property of the machine.
