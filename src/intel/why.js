/**
 * The why-tutor.
 *
 * Every CAD package has documentation and none of it is read at the moment it
 * would matter. Help explains which button does what; the thing a student or a
 * new engineer actually lacks is knowing *why* one choice is better than another
 * at the point where they are about to make it.
 *
 * So this is not a tour and not a tooltip. Lessons are bound to observable
 * states of the document, they surface at most one at a time, they surface only
 * when their condition is genuinely true right now, and each one is dismissed
 * for good once it has been read. A lesson that fires twice has failed.
 *
 * Precedence is deliberate: a Doctor finding always outranks a general lesson,
 * because a concrete problem in front of you teaches better than a principle in
 * the abstract. The tutor is an explanation layer over the checks rather than a
 * separate stream of advice competing with them.
