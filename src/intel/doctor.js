/**
 * The Design Doctor: continuous validation, and repairs that keep design intent.
 *
 * Conventional CAD answers "is this geometry valid?" and leaves the more useful
 * question alone: will this part actually work, and can the shop you are sending
 * it to make it? The Doctor runs after every rebuild and turns that into a
 * ranked list of findings, each one carrying three things a bare error message
 * never does — what is wrong, why it matters, and where possible a repair the
 * user can apply without understanding the internals.
 *
 * Two rules govern everything here.
 *
 * It never edits on its own. Every repair is a described, single-step, undoable
 * edit the user chooses. Software that silently "fixes" a model teaches you not
 * to trust it.
 *
 * It never claims more precision than it has. Several of these checks are honest
 * proxies rather than exact analyses: real minimum-wall detection wants a medial
 * axis, and interference wants a mesh-mesh intersection. Where a check is a
 * proxy the finding says so in its own text, so a user is never misled about
 * what has been verified. Nothing here is a substitute for FEA or a DFM review.
