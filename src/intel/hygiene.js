/**
 * What actually kills a large CAD file.
 *
 * The complaints are specific and they are never about the modelling: "contains
 * proxy objects from Civil 3D... very high coordinates... objects are far away
 * ... zoom extents makes objects smaller than a pixel", and crashes diagnosed
 * as "remove proxy objects", and empty groups that freeze a scene. None of
 * that is a geometry problem. It is a data-hygiene problem, and the software
 * is in a far better position to find it than the user is.
 *
 * Four things are checked here, each with a repair where the intent is
 * recoverable:
 *
 *   Far from the origin. Geometry at survey coordinates loses precision,
 *   because a float32 has about seven significant digits: at 500 km from the
 *   origin the smallest representable step is tens of millimetres, so a 0.1mm
 *   feature cannot be represented at all. This is the one that makes a model
 *   look subtly wrong in ways nobody can explain, and it is arithmetic rather
 *   than opinion, so the report gives the actual precision loss in millimetres.
 *
 *   Duplicated payloads. Two imported meshes with identical triangles are two
 *   copies of the same megabytes. Hashing them and pointing the duplicates at
 *   one copy is what game engines call deduplication, and it costs nothing.
 *
 *   Empty and degenerate features. A feature with a zero dimension, a pattern
 *   of one, a boolean with nothing to combine: each contributes no geometry and
 *   some cost, and every one of them is a thing the user meant to finish.
 *
 *   Weight. Where the document's bytes actually are, so "why is this file 40
 *   megabytes" has an answer.
 *
 * Nothing here changes the document. Every finding carries a `fix` the caller
 * applies on the user's say-so, one undo step each.

 * it. The result would merely appear near the origin afterwards.
