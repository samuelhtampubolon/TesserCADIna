/**
 * The desktop shell.
 *
 * TesserCAD is a static site, so a desktop build is a browser window with the
 * browser taken away. That framing is what makes this file short, and short is
 * the point: every line of shell is attack surface that the web version does
 * not have, because on the web the browser's own sandbox does this job.
 *
 * The security posture is therefore the whole content of this file, and it is
 * deliberately the strictest configuration Electron offers rather than the
 * default one:
 *
 *   sandbox            on. The renderer runs in an OS-level sandbox.
 *   contextIsolation   on. Page scripts cannot reach Electron's internals.
 *   nodeIntegration    off. `require` does not exist in the page. An XSS in a
 *                      shell with node integration is not a script injection,
 *                      it is arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
 *   no preload         there is nothing the page needs from the host, so there
 *                      is no bridge to audit. The application already runs
 *                      unmodified in a browser; giving it privileges here
 *                      would mean maintaining two behaviours.
 *   webSecurity        on. Same-origin policy applies, and the app's own
 *                      Content-Security-Policy is served with the page, so the
 *                      desktop build is governed by the same rules as the web
 *                      build rather than a relaxed variant.
 *
 * Navigation and window creation are refused outright. A CAD application has
 * no reason to follow a link to another origin, and a shell that can be
 * navigated is a shell that can be pointed at a page somebody else controls.
 * External links open in the user's real browser, where they belong.
 *
 * Loaded over a private `app://` scheme rather than file:// or a loopback HTTP
 * server. ES modules and the import map need a real origin, which file:// does
 * not usefully provide, and a loopback server would hand every other process
 * on the machine a port that serves the user's documents for as long as the
 * window is open. The scheme is registered standard and secure, so the page
 * gets a proper origin and a secure context while the only route to the disk
 * is the handler in protocol.cjs. See that file for the reasoning in full.

/**
 * Let WebGL fall back to software rendering when there is no usable GPU.
 *
 * A 3D modeller that will not start is worse than a slow one, and from
 * Chromium 137 the software fallback is refused unless this switch is present:
 * the window opens, WebGL2 reports "blocklisted", and nothing draws. That is
 * the state on a virtual machine, over remote desktop, on a locked-down
 * corporate image, and on genuinely old hardware — not exotic places for a CAD
 * user to be.
 *
 * The switch is named "unsafe" because software rendering has a weaker
 * sandbox, and that warning is aimed at browsers running pages from the open
 * web. This shell renders one local, first-party application over its own
 * scheme, with no navigation anywhere else and a Content-Security-Policy that
 * permits no third-party origin, so the content the warning is about cannot
 * get here. On a machine with a working GPU this changes nothing: hardware
 * WebGL is still chosen first.

 * Stop Chromium's own background services from reaching the network.

 * refuses one. None of that governs the browser *around* the page. Chromium
 * ships a component updater, a domain-reliability reporter and a variations
 * ("field trial") client that talk to Google infrastructure on their own
 * schedule, outside any page and outside any policy the page can set.
 *
 * Running the packaged build with a network monitor showed exactly that: a
 * connection attempt to redirector.gvt1.com, Google's component-update
 * redirector, from a window that had loaded nothing but local files.
 *
 * For an application whose whole claim is that your documents stay on your
 * machine, "the page made no request" is not the same promise as "the program
 * made no request", and only the second one is worth making. These switches
 * turn the difference off.

 * same as preventing.
 *
 * This resolves every hostname to nothing, for every process in the
 * application. It is safe here precisely because this build has nothing to
 * resolve: the page is served from the `app://` scheme by an in-process
 * handler, there is no loopback server, and the application makes no request
 * of its own. External links are unaffected — `shell.openExternal` hands the
 * URL to the real browser, which has its own resolver.
 *
 * So the claim the README makes about the desktop build is not "we turned the
 * telemetry off". It is that the program cannot reach the network, and this
