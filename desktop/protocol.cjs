/**
 * How the desktop build reads its own files, separated from the shell.
 *
 * This file exists apart from main.cjs for one reason: it holds the only
 * security-critical logic in the desktop build, and main.cjs cannot be loaded
 * outside Electron, so nothing inside it can be tested. Path containment is
 * exactly the kind of code that must be tested rather than reviewed, so it
 * lives here where `node` can require it and `tools/tests/desktop.mjs` can
 * attack it directly.
 *
 * ## Why a custom scheme rather than a loopback HTTP server
 *
 * The first version of this served the application from `http://127.0.0.1` on
 * an OS-assigned port. That works, and it is what most Electron applications
 * do, but it has two costs that a custom scheme does not:
 *
 * A listening socket is reachable by everything else on the machine. Bound to
 * loopback it is not on the network, but every other process running as that
 * user can connect to it for as long as the window is open. For an
 * application whose whole claim is that your documents stay yours, handing out
 * a port that serves those documents to any local caller is the wrong shape,
 * even when the port is random and the surface is a read-only allowlist.
 *
 * And opening a port, then serving an application out of it, is behaviour that
 * endpoint protection notices. That is not a reason to make a security
 * decision on its own, but here the more private option is also the quieter
 * one, so there is no trade to weigh.
 *
 * `file://` is not the alternative. ES modules and the import map need a real
 * origin, and under `file://` every local file is same-origin with the page,
 * which is a worse position than either of the above. A scheme registered as
 * `standard` and `secure` gives the page a genuine origin (`app://tessercad`),
 * makes it a secure context so workers behave as they do on the web, and
 * reaches the disk through this handler and nothing else.

 * The extension allowlist is a second, independent barrier: even a path that
